Angella currently works as a Lecturer for the M.Sc. Digital Design (MDD) programme at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), and as a Researcher for both the Fashion Research & Technology (FRT) and Civic Interaction Design (CIxD) groups at AUAS. Angella holds a doctorate degree from the Eindhoven University of Technology and Signify Research (formerly Philips Lighting Research) as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral fellow with ArcInTex ETN. Since 2007, Mackey’s design practise has investigated wearable technologies in art, research and commercial contexts. She has designed hyper-functional garments in a wide range of industries, from medical to commercial space flight, and lectured in various settings on the design challenges for integrating electronics into fashion. Most notably, she founded Vega Wearable Light, a line of illuminated outerwear for style-conscious cyclists from 2010-2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
