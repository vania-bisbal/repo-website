Gabriele Jureviciute is a Lithuanian architect with a Master’s Degree in Advanced Architecture from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC). She is currently working as the academic coordinator of the Master in Advanced Architecture (MAA01) at IAAC, a faculty member of the Advanced Manufacturing Thesis Cluster and the Fab.AR (Manual Fabrication Assisted with Augmented Reality) Seminar.

Gabriele’s professional interests include sustainable and responsive architecture, digital fabrication, and material circularity. Her master thesis project developed in 2018/19 at IAAC was based on the topic “Plastic Emergency Architecture: Creating low-cost, accessible architecture from waste material, improving liveability in areas affected by mismanaged plastic waste”. The project has been exhibited during the events such as Barcelona Building Construmat 2019 and Architects@Work Madrid 2019. Moreover, it has been developed further during the Residency program at Autodesk Build Space in Boston.
