Holon emerged in 2014 as a proposal from the design community to what we see is humanity in transition.

From non-profit cooperatives, associations, and foundations transforming sectors such as housing or energy, to local SMEs exploring the circular economy, to programs of the United Nations working on eco-innovation or international corporations defining how sustainability fits companies of their size. We exist to help these organizations become the new normal through design. We work to align their organizational goals with the needs of the people they serve and their social and environmental context. From experiences to the ecosystem, we shape the everyday life of transitions.
