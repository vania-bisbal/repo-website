Sally is a multi-disciplinary professional whose background includes biology; ecological economics; teaching, marketing, communications and events both in the USA and Spain. She uses her diverse background and a transecofeminist perspective to support the creation of a just present based on citizen-centred societies and economies that produce locally and connect globally, particularly around sustainable food systems and social & environmental justice. She is passionate about making information accessible to people of all backgrounds and equipping citizens with the tools to participate in creating the world around them. Currently, Sally is an action researcher at Fab Lab Barcelona. Most recently, she was project manager for the first phase of Food Tech 3.0, one of nine Accelerator Labs for the H2020 EU project FoodSHIFT 2030.
