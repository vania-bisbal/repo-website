Moving to Barcelona happened too fast. Everything occurred in one weekend; my last day of work was a Friday. On Saturday, I was traveling, landing on Sunday, and started classes on Monday. 

Pre-courses helped me a lot to have a quick view of what we were going to see in MDEF; it was really fun. And then, the landing week in MDEF was my third week in Barcelona, so it was the actual moment when I felt I landed in the city.

Pictures explain it better; you can check my landing here!
