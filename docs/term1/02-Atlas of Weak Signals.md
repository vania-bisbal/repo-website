We can reconfigure out minds, congnitivity, body, health, etc.
Deconstruct our built sistemic thinking is a way of reconfiguration.
Algorithms to biohack yourself sound really interesting because if technology and climate change are evolving, we could evolve in different ways to adapt to these futures.
Digital fabrications can be use to distribute or communicate on an easier way how a body reconfiguration works or maybe collaborate with the technology in-house to do it.
Climate consciousness is as difficult as climate change, but the first one can't be seen.
What would happen if we wouldn't were configured to eat packaged food, drive to work, wear new clothes or print in paper?
