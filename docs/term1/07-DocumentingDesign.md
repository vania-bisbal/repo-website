# Documenting Desgin 


Creating this website was challenging and fun. 
Even though I still feel like I know very little about coding, I have my website working quite well. 
Among all the template options, I decided to stick with the basic MDEF one because I wanted to explore HTML with MKdocs and CSS on my own. I've been using ChatGPT, Squidfunk, and my classmates' notes and help. I will continue on this journey throughout the masters.
