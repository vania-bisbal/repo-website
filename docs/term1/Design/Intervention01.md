# Design Intervention 
==============================================================

Building this design intervention was a continuous evolution and a constant reminder of what a first-person perspective (1PP) entails.

Take a look to our intervention:

Nevertheless despite that it seems that everything had to do with transport it started in refugees. 
I made a drawing to simplify it:

As I mentioned before this intervention was a constant reminder of refocusing into 1PP. 
We created a collective design space and started building connections within our classmates. 
Four of us decided to team up to create our own collective design space:

We brainstormed some ideas and providing maker education to any person in Barcelona related to hygene seemed pretty fair.

We reflected A LOTTTTT about this design intervention and we decided to bring it more closer. This wasnt 1PP. 
How might we experience something similar to refugees or to someone in a vulnerable situation? We had to reflect about us, our condition, our migration to Barcelona. And it that moment we realized that our process of moving to BCN and not having papers and having to deal with it is a topic to be raised.
