# People 2 People Intervention
AKA Futuristic Sexual Interactions Intervention

In this intervention, my team and I were interested in gathering data from our bodies and/or our surroundings and using it to envision a futuristic situation that prompts reflection on how one can engage with this data.

## Some of Our Inspirations & Ideas

- Idea A: A menstrual cycle companion, which would be tattoo sensible to body temperature done with thermochromic ink. Inspired in Nanoengineer and Rihannaâ€™s tattoo artist are developping a smart tattoo ink: https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2023/09/09/nanoengineer-and-rihannas-tattoo-artist-plan-to-sell-smart-tattoo-ink/ - related to the idea of 
- Idea B: A day in the future where you could have a personal digital art installation of your personal heart rate changes, and other data gathered during the day.

The Intervention Concept: Futuristic Sexual Interactions
The concept of pleasure and physical enjoyment is no longer directed by person-to-person connection but by machine-to-machine interaction directed by two proximity sensors. These sensors create a fictitious connection between two people, charged with intimacy and pleasure. The connection results in an interaction between two digital models that touch and interact as if it were a condition of sexual intimacy, bringing pleasure.

## Implementation
We used a Barduino to gather real-time data from a proximity sensor and connected it to Blender. We created a model in Blender that visually represented how the sensors could relate together and used a skin texture and light to enhance the visuals.
