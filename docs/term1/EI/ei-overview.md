# Extended Intelligences 
About the faculty: Pau Artigas <br>
Pau Artigas is an Interactive Web Developer at Taller Estampa. Estampa is a collective of programmers, filmmakers and researchers, with a practice based on a critical and archaeological approach to audiovisual and digital technologies. Since 2017 they have developed an important amount of work focused on the uses and ideologies of AI, an interest that started with a project programmatically entitled The Bad Pupil. Critical pedagogy for Artificial Intelligences (2017-2018).

## El mal alumne ––Pedagogia crítica per a AI
Extract from the book - Estampa
**Compulsive experts** p. 55
The world of art has been the starting point for two training sessions. In the first one, Wikiart's categorization categories and its image corpus were used to teach a network to recognize artistic styles. In this situation, artificial vision is forced to confront the idea of artistic style and movements, doing so from a purely formal perspective, avoiding any conceptual consideration, an area that, by definition, is beyond its understanding. In the second case, the training datasets consist of collections from various artistic institutions in Barcelona (MACBA, MNAC, Fundació Miró, Fundació Tàpies, Museu Picasso, and Museu del Disseny). The images in each collection are extremely heterogeneous. Forced to synthesize them, the network ends up producing absurd interpretations. In these cases, artificial vision serves to satirize the discourse on art based on classification, which inevitably homogenizes and simplifies artistic production (img. 24 and 25). While image classification networks are obsessive and compulsive, linking everything to the vocabulary they have learned, these two generate connections between any image and artistic vocabulary (img. 22).

The training of artificial vision networks has also been carried out in other areas. In some cases, efforts were made to have the network focus more on the image than on the objects represented: we are talking about identifying concepts related to composition or representation of space (vanishing point and horizon, assuming the ideal spectator's perspective) or devices for creating the image (for example, webcam, phone, etc.). In other cases, the network was trained to identify particularly elusive artists such as Cindy Sherman or Joan Fontcuberta (img. 23).
