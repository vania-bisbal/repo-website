During the seminar led by Andrés Colmenares, we explored the role of design in addressing the climate crisis. This journey began with collaborative discussions that defined our focus on the digital economy’s environmental implications.

Here are some of our collective takeaways:

We engaged in hands-on activities, notably a field trip to CosmoCaixa, which underscored our planet's fragility and the impact of our design choices. The session on 'degrowth' was particularly enlightening, challenging our assumptions about consumption and economic growth.

This seminar significantly broadened my understanding and will undoubtedly influence my future projects. The discussions and activities, particularly the concept of 'degrowth', provided fresh perspectives on how to approach economic and environmental sustainability. These insights challenge me to rethink the way I engage with technology and design within my own sphere of influence. Moving forward, I am committed to applying these critical lessons in practical and impactful ways.
