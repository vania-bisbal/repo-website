# Future Talks

Future Talks is a series of conversations with friends of ELISAVA and Fab Lab Barcelona, exploring the nature of emerging futures from the past to the present and beyond.

## About the Distributed Design Platform:
Emerging at the intersection of the Maker Movement and design sensibility, Distributed Design provides a framework for designers, makers and creatives to innovate the field of design towards more sustainable, open, inclusive and collaborative practices. It is a proactive response for makers and designs to prefigure viable design alternatives to the current paradigm designed for mass consumption.
