# Autoethnography, Alternative Presents & Ways of Drifting

In this course, we've explored Design Autoethnography, a qualitative research method focused on analyzing personal experiences within socio-technical systems. I've reflected on my own narrative through autoethnography, recognizing the importance of self-reflexive activation in infusing the design process with principles like responsibility, accountability, transparency, empathy, and positionality. This course has equipped me to navigate a transformative design process, allowing me to craft a personal vision for designing in the unknown, with a deeper understanding and empathy. It's been a journey of growth, integrating my experiences into my approach to creative problem-solving.

# Alternative Presents

Exploring alternative presents is not just about envisioning different futures; it's about understanding our overarching narratives and making sense of the paths we're forging through collective design interventions. These alternative presents provide designers with the opportunity to unlock escape routes from present continuities, offering a space to boldly imagine and explore discontinuities. By doing so, we can envision more optimistic future scenarios, diverging from the narrow outcomes presented by our current business-as-usual practices. It's through this exploration of alternative presents that we can actively shape for a more innovative and hopeful tomorrow.
