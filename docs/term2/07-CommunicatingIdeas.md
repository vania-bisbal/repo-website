Why: I aim to positively impact the future of our work by exploring how we interact with technology (hardware and software today) and the consequences of technological fatigue. I'm also keen on understanding the influence of remote working on our professional lives. My goal is to contribute to a future where technology meets well-being in balanced ways. And probably introducing nature to the experience. 

How
I plan to change the way we think about and use technology by introducing new experiences. By using art installations and visual projections, I want to raise conversations about the influence of tech in our lives. And explore hoe we can find less exhausting ways to work, study, or research with immersive experiences. These experiences are meant to make people think about their tech habits and imagine a future where technology supports us in healthier ways.

What
My project is about creating engaging, immersive experiences that challenge the way we interact with technology. Through art and visuals, I'll present alternatives that encourage us to reflect on our tech use. The aim is to spark discussions and thoughts about how we can use technology in a way that's beneficial and balanced, avoiding tech burnout.
