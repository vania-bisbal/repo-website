## Designing with Extended Intilligences 
The seminar was well designed to deepen our understanding of artificial intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on its practical application. 

Hosted by Pietro and Chris, both alumni of MDEF, the session was marked by its dynamic and engaging approach to exploring AI and its immense potential. The seminar initiated, off course, by defining AI and the evolution of these models.

Pietro and Chris are also members of a collective called Dottod, through which they have initiated a series of really interesting projects. Their work within this collective aims to spark discussions on a variety of important topics, including politics, design, technology, and more. Take a look here https://www.dottod.net/ and here https://furnitures.dottod.net/

Particularly, I liked how they use AI in their projects to raise awareness of the technology's power, highlight its biases, and blend it with art to provoke reflection.

Here are some prompts that Nuria, Marius, and I experimented with.

In this activity, we tried with various prompts to see how the images would change. We also used some cameras, filters, and extra elmentss I've previously used to generate images in Midjourney to compare it to this model.
