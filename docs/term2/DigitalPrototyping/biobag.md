## Preparation and materials
Dive into the references provided in this page, select your recipes and create your sample. 

Be careful. Check you have all the tools and materials needed before starting. Enjoy the process! 
Prepare in advance:
- 2D file ready to be laser cut
- Acrylic or similar material to use for the mold 




!!! example " Equipment, Tools and Materials"

	=== "Equipment for Documentation"

        * Table + chairs
        * Video recording and photo set up

	=== "Tools"
        	  
        * Pot 
        * Stove
        * Digital scale
        * Syringe


	=== "Materials"
       
        * 12gr Gelatine (Biopolymer)
        * 60ml Water (Solvent)
        * 7.2gr  Glycerine 9% (Plasticizer)
        * Natural Colorings: Gold Mica and Red Mica 


##Step by Step Instructions

!!! example "STEP BY STEP overview"

    === "step 1: Prepare the Mold"
        * Create your design for the bag. 
        * Draw the design in a 2D software (Ex.Illustrator)
        * Save it as .dxf and open it in Rhino for lasser configurations 
        * Set up the lasser cutting space and machine 
        * Select the colors for cutting correctly 
        * Take the final pieces and paste it on a flat material with super glue. 

	=== "step 2: Prepare the Gelatine mix"
        * Add the Gelatine to the water.
        * Warm the mix until it becomes homogeneous, do not boil .
        * Add the glycerine and stir.
        * Add the selected colors and stir again.

	=== "step 3: Pour and eliminate bubbles"
        * Take the Gelatine polymer mix. 
        * Pour the mix onto the mold.
        * Tap the mold so the mix distributes evenly over the surface.
        * Remove bubbles with a scissors. 
        * Add extra colorful decoration 

	=== "step 4: Dry "
        * Let it dry for 5 days

        === "step 6: Removal "
        * Take out of the frame after 5 days.
        * Pull slowly from the border of the bioplastic until completely detached.
        * Use a cutter if needed of correct the borders.


**Safety rules & Tips**  

-  Working with an induction heat plate is safer  
- Do not stand inhaling over the pot if there is alcohol in the recipe  
- Use towels to pick up hot pots  
- Use a lab coat or apron for keeping yourself clean  
- Tie your hair up
