| Complexity | Skills |  Duration |   
| :-----:| :-------: | :-----: | 
| Medium | Mycelium & 3D printing |1 week |

## First, let's start with a 3D mold
!!! example " Tools and Procedure"

	=== "Tools"
        	  
        * 3D printer 
        * Filament


	=== "Step by step procedure"
        * Create your 3D model in Rhinoceros or any other 3D software. 
        * Save it and open it Ultimaker Cura to slice it for the 3D printer. 
        * Set up the base, walls, type of filament etc. 
        * Send to print and observe at least the first 3 layers to see if the printing is doing ok.

## Mycelium Procedure
!!! example " Ingredients and Procedure"

	=== "Ingredients"
        * Straw
        * Flour
        * Mycelium kit previously made
        * Water

        === "Other tools"
        * Bowl
        * Alcohol
        * Plastic Wrap
        * Gloves & safety googles
        * Dehydrator, oven or pressure cooker
        * Camping gas

        === "Sterilization"
        * Sterilise straw and 3D printed mold for 45 min in the pressure cooker. 
        * Disinfect your table and bowls with alcohol.
        * Turn on camping gas to create a sterilization bubble.

	=== "Mycelium mix procedure"
        * Add the Mycelium Kit to the bowl
        * Add straw, flour and mix well with hands
        * Place the Mycelium in the mold
        * Wrap mold in plastic and poke small holes 
        * Let it grow for 1 week in the dark.

**Reflection**
Learning to grow mycelium has been a fascinating experience. I started by looking for inspiration on Pinterest and TikTok, where I saw people creating impressive items like lamps and containers out of mycelium.

As I am new to Rhino, I searched for Rhino files on Thingiverse to use as a base for 3D printing the mold. The most challenging part was keeping everything sterile. It required some effort, but once I managed it, growing mycelium turned out to be quite straightforward.

What I find most exciting about mycelium are its unique properties. Itâ€™s fireproof, cleans the air, and is biodegradable, making it an excellent material for sustainable design. I am enthusiastic about the numerous possibilities mycelium offers and look forward to exploring them further.
