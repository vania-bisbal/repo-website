| Complexity | Skills |  Duration |   
| :---:| :---------: | :---: | 
| Medium | Mycelium & 3D printing |1 week |

## First, let's start with a 3D mold
!!! example " Tools and Procedure"

	=== "Tools"
        	  
        * 3D printer 
        * Filament


	=== "Step by step procedure"
        * Create your 3D model in Rhinoceros or any other 3D software. 
        * Save it and open it Ultimaker Cura to slice it for the 3D printer. 
        * Set up the base, walls, type of filament etc. 
        * Send to print and observe at least the first 3 layers to see if the printing is doing ok.

## Mycelium Procedure
!!! example " Ingredients and Procedure"

	=== "Ingredients"
        * Straw
        * Flour

        * Dehydrator, oven or pressure cooker
        * Camping gas

        === "Sterilization"
        * Sterilise straw and 3D printed mold for 45 min in the pressure cooker 
        * Desinfect your table and bowls with alcohol
        * Turn on camping gas for creating a sterilisation bubble

	=== "Mycelium mix procedure"
        * Add the Mycelium Kit to the bowl
        * Add straw, flour and mix well with hands
        * Place the Mycelium in the mold
        * Wrap mold in plastic and poke small holes

**Reflection**
I began this first trial searching for some inspiration in pinterest and tiktok and found some cool experiences. 
Then as im just initiating with Rhino I decided to search for Rhino files in thingiverse that I could use as a base for 3d printing the mold.
