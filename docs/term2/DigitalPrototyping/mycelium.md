## Preparation and materials
Be careful. Check you have all the tools and materials needed before starting. Enjoy the process! 

Prepare in advance:
- Create a 3D Rhino file ready to 3D printed

!!! example " Equipment, Tools and Materials"

	=== "Equipment for Documentation"

        * Table + chairs
        * Video recording and photo set up

	=== "Tools"
        	  
        * 3D printer 
        * Filament


	=== "Materials"
       
        * Mycelium
        * Water

        
##Step by Step Instructions

!!! example "STEP BY STEP overview"

    === "step 1: Prepare the 3D Mold"
        * Create your 3D model in Rhino or any other 3D sw. 
        * Save it and open it Ultimaker Cura to slice it for the 3D printer. 
        * Set up the base, walls, type of filament etc. 
        * Send to print and observe at least the first 3 layers to see if its doing ok.

	=== "step 2: Prepare the Mycelium mix"
        * Add the Gelatine to the water.
        * Warm the mix until it  becomes homogeneous, do not boil .
        * Add the glycerine and stir.
        * Add the selected colors and stir again.

	=== "step 3: Place the Mycelium in the mold"
        * Take the Gelatine polymer mix. 
        * Pour the mix onto the mold.
        * Tap the mold so the mix distributes evenly over the surface.
        * Remove bubbles with a scissors. 
        * Add extra colorful decoration 

	=== "step 4: Grow "
        * Let it grow for 1 week in the dark. 

      

**Reflection**
I began this first trial searching for some inspiration in pinterest and tiktok and found some cool experiences. 
Then as im just initiating with Rhino I decided to search for Rhino files in thingiverse that I could use as a base for 3d printing the mold. 

* Here are some of the files I found cool: * <br>
**[Flower pot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3598511)** - it has a system for an easy removal of the cast if you are not using a flexible material. <br>
**[Duny mold](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:438250)**- cute character which prints in 10 minutes. <br>
