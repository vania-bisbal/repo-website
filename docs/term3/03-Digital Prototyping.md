Material: *velostat*, is a variable resistor, lets elecctricity flow thru a systema or not. Might work as a potenciometer. You can modulate how electricity flows within a circuit. 


Concepts_
What is the body: medium or tool of expression AND is also a topic of research
She does performance art. The body is political and the body has something to tell. 
If the body is a territorry that we inhabit, how do we connect with it. 
Data can be translated into other types of signals. 
Emojis as a way of communication. 
What makes us emotional? physical event, social interactions, remembering/imagining specific event, etc. 
*Affective Computing / Robotics* Madeline Ganon - make the robot move using a natural language that we can understand
*Expresivity in human environments*: Digit - Agility Robotics


Some projects_
- Live coding: visuals sharing code in real time. Normally it has 2 screens, i coding for coding and the other for visuals. 2 mobile phones, with an app with all the information about mobile phones (orientation, apps, etc). 
- Online algorithmic video performance: project Metonimia del cuerpo 
- Body algortihms: project cinestesia. USing a nano arduino with conductive fabrics. Exploracion de movimientos con artefactos robÃ³ticos. 
- Emodying memes small raspberry: pi zw has wifi and can connect a camera

About the answers:
1 message answer
- We are going to train wekinator if we are in 1 move to 0. 
- We can also train 3 different emotions (1,2,3)
2 message answer
- We can also say while x =0 and y=1, then Z, while x=1 and y =1 then W
- Type *custom* > configure> osc message> /cara > with> integer (which means 2 answers)
