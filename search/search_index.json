In a second-person perspective, the designer is socially involved and facilitates co-design sessions or other kinds of workshops or forms of participation with users and professional experts who are part of the context.   A first-person perspective means that designers are personally involved since they are part of and actors in the system object of study.

I have chosen to investigate neuroplasticity and its associated challenges.</p> <p>Neuroplasticity is a lifelong phenomenon occurring at all stages of life, with heightened significance during critical periods of development, particularly in early childhood. During this time, the brain is remarkably adaptable, and experiences can profoundly impact neural circuitry.</p> <p>In infancy and early childhood, the brain undergoes rapid growth and development, representing a sensitive period when neural circuits are highly malleable, and the brain is particularly responsive to environmental stimuli. Nutrition plays a crucial role in supporting brain development and neuroplasticity, especially during the rapid growth of early childhood. This involves forming new connections and enhancing synaptic plasticity.</p> <p>Several nutrients are essential for optimal brain function and the promotion of neuroplasticity. Here are some key nutrients and their roles:</p> <ol> <li>Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Essential for the development and function of the brain, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Commonly found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.</li> <li>Iron: Critical for the development of myelin, a substance that insulates nerve fibers and facilitates efficient communication between neurons. Iron deficiency, especially during early childhood, can lead to cognitive deficits and impair neuroplasticity. Good sources include lean meats, beans, lentils, and fortified cereals.</li> <li>Zinc: Involved in various neurochemical processes and essential for the formation and function of synapses. Found in meat, dairy products, nuts, and whole grains.</li> <li>Vitamins B6, B9 (Folate), and B12: Important for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Adequate levels support cognitive function and may influence neuroplasticity. Found in leafy green vegetables, legumes, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals.</li> <li>Vitamin D: Linked to brain development and cognitive function. Obtained from sunlight exposure, fatty fish, fortified dairy products, and egg yolks.</li> <li>Choline: A precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for memory and learning. Found in eggs, meat, fish, and certain plant-based sources like soybeans.</li> <li>Protein: Essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and overall brain structure and function. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, beans, and legumes.</li> </ol> <p>Within this array of nutrients, I have chosen to delve deeper into Iron. Iron deficiency anemia is a global issue affecting 2 billion people worldwide, particularly women and children [3]. One of my communities of interest is Latin America, specifically Peru, where anemia remains prevalent, especially in rural highland areas. Anemia poses a significant burden to smallholding farmers and their families.</p> <p>In light of this, I am considering researching potatoes due to their widespread consumption and cost-effectiveness. Potatoes, the fourth most important crop in Latin America, are crucial in the Peruvian highlands, serving as a staple with daily consumption reaching 800 g and 200 g for women and children, respectively [5].</p> <p>Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that the bioaccessibility of iron in potato is 63 to 79%, significantly higher than that found in wheat, common bean, and pearl millet [2]. Bioaccessibility measures the percentage of iron that is released after in vitro gastrointestinal cell digestion (Caco-2) and is therefore available for intestinal absorption. Thus, although potatoes contain relatively low levels of iron and zinc, their high consumption rates and likely high bioavailability make them an excellent source of these minerals compared with cereal and legume crops [12].</p> <p>Genes of Interest: - IRT1 (Iron-Regulated Transporter 1): Responsible for iron uptake from the soil. - FRO2 (Ferric Reduction Oxidase 2): Involved in the reduction of iron for uptake. - NAS (Nicotianamine Synthase): Facilitates the transport of iron within the plant. - YSL (Yellow Stripe-Like): Involved in the transport of iron within plant cells.</p> <p>Genetic Modification Approach: This research proposes a comprehensive genetic modification approach to enhance iron uptake in potatoes. The process initiates with the isolation of Genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant naturally harboring the IRT1 gene responsible for iron uptake. Utilizing PCR Amplification, the IRT1 gene is selectively amplified from the genomic DNA using specific primers. To further augment the iron uptake capabilities, additional genes\u2014FRO2 (Ferric Reduction Oxidase 2), NAS (Nicotianamine Synthase), and YSL (Yellow Stripe-Like)\u2014are integrated into the genetic construct. These genes play crucial roles in the reduction of iron for uptake (FRO2), facilitation of iron transport within the plant (NAS), and transport of iron within plant cells (YSL). The next step involves the incorporation of these genes into the cloning vector. This vector, acting as a carrier, introduces the cluster of genes (IRT1, FRO2, NAS, YSL) into the potato organism.</p> <p>Transformation Techniques: I have researched two different technologies used in genetic engineering, serving distinct purposes in the process of introducing foreign genes into a host organism: CRISPR-Cas9 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Exploring both of them can lead us to different but more accurate results.</p> <p>CRISPR-Cas9 Transformation Process: - Designing Guide RNAs (gRNAs): Design gRNAs that target specific locations in the potato genome where you want to introduce or modify genes (IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL). - Cas9 Protein Production: Produce the Cas9 protein or use a pre-made Cas9 protein. This protein will act as molecular \u201cscissors,\u201d cutting the DNA at the targeted location. - Delivery System: Develop a delivery system for the CRISPR-Cas9 components. This can involve creating plasmids that carry the Cas9 gene, along with the designed gRNAs. - Introduction into Potato Cells: Introduce the CRISPR-Cas9 components into potato cells. This can be done using various methods, such as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation or particle bombardment. - Genetic Modification: The Cas9 protein will create breaks in the potato genome at the locations specified by the gRNAs. The cell\u2019s natural repair machinery will then attempt to fix these breaks, potentially incorporating the desired genes (IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL) or making modifications to existing genes. - Selection and Screening: Select transformed cells that have successfully incorporated the desired genetic modifications. Screening methods, such as PCR and sequencing, can be used to verify the presence of the inserted or modified genes. - Regeneration of Transgenic Plants: Regenerate whole plants from the modified cells. This involves growing plants from the transformed cells under controlled conditions. - Testing and Analysis: Evaluate the expression of the introduced genes in the transgenic plants.</p> <p>Agrobacterium tumefaciens Transformation Process: - Selection of Genetic Material: The genes IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL are chosen as the genetic material for introduction into the potato. - Construction of Binary Vector: These selected genes, along with their regulatory elements, are incorporated into a binary vector. This vector also contains a T-DNA segment for transfer to the potato. - Transformation of Agrobacterium: The binary vector, now carrying IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL, is introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens through a suitable transformation method. - Culturing Agrobacterium: The transformed Agrobacterium is cultured to increase the population of cells. The binary vector replicates within the bacterium. - Induction of Virulence Genes: Environmental signals induce the virulence genes in Agrobacterium, triggering the transfer of T-DNA, carrying IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL, to the potato host. - Cocultivation with Potato Cells: Potato tissues or cells are exposed to the Agrobacterium culture, facilitating the transfer of T-DNA into the potato cells. - Integration into Potato Genome: The transferred T-DNA, now containing IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL, integrates into the potato genome at random sites. - Regeneration of Transgenic Potato Plants: Transformed potato cells are cultured to regenerate into whole plants. This involves selecting and regenerating potato plants that carry the introduced genes. - Screening and Confirmation: Transgenic potato plants are screened to identify those expressing IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL. Molecular and phenotypic analyses confirm the successful incorporation of these genes.</p> <p>Final Reflection </p> <p>Exploring genetics and iron metabolism has been very interesting. From studying neuroplasticity to understanding the intricacies of genes like IRT1, FRO2, NAS, and YSL, the journey uncovered the coolness of genetic modification. Learning the processes, from gene isolation to CRISPR-Cas9 and Agrobacterium-mediated transformations, revealed the precision and versatility of genetic tools. This exploration goes beyond the lab, emphasizing ethical considerations and the need for rigorous testing when manipulating genetic information. It\u2019s not just science; it\u2019s a conscientious journey into the potential impact on ecosystems, agriculture, and human health.

As a team, we were interested in topics related to body, real vs. online identity, human behaviors, and surveillance. Consequently, we decided to look into emotion detection and facial recognition models. </p> <p>How it started? In the initial stages, we brainstormed various proposals where facial recognition or emotion detection could be useful. Some of our ideas included a lie detector, assistance for helping visually impaired individuals identify emotions, an emotion collector integrated into a product, and utilizing emotions to detect mental health issues. However, after careful consideration, we opted to explore the potential of AI for futuristic human romantic interactions: specifically, how we could use a flirt detector to help people find love.</p> <p>The value proposition statement: Using emotion detection to detect flirty behaviours, we can help people  with a more efficient way to understand when people are flirting in face to face settings so that they find love easily</p> <p>How we chose the model? We explored Kaggle, Huggingface, Reflect to find models or APIs relevant to our project. Eventually, we stumbled upon a model created by an Italian developer on GitHub who utilizes DeepFace and OpenCV to construct an emotion detection model specifically designed for computer vision.</p> <p>DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook. It identifies human faces in digital images. The program employs a nine-layer neural network with over 120 million connection weights and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users. It has 98% accuracy, which is more than the human eye. </p> <p> </p> <p>OpenCV is a large open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role for real-time operations in today\u2019s AI systems.</p> <p>Our First Attempt: GitHub As we dove into the GitHub model to integrate it into our project, we realized it required us to enable the use of the webcam for real-time videos. As we were working with Google Colab, we could not open our own cameras as it operates on a distant hosting network, not on our computer. We therefore had to adapt the code given on GitHub with Pau and Marc\u2019s help, to have the AI detect emotions on videos that we would upload to the hosting network ourselves. We however acknowledged that in a subsequent exploration, we could experiment with real-life videos.</p> <p>Coding process with Google Colab: Coding this system on Google Colab required us to clone the GitHub repository and install both the DeepFace and OpenCV libraries.   We then coded the model to recognise faces and put a frame around faces on videos. At first, the system was recognising faces in objects, so with Marc\u2019s help, we refined the code for the face recognition mechanism to be more precise.   Once that was done, we had to cut videos as they were going to be processed for too long: the emotion recognition system was analyzing 60 frames per second.  The second part of the code was using commands to recognise emotions in these frames. However, when running that part of the code, the faces were being recognised and framed in the videos but the emotions were not being labeled. This was because our model was not finding emotions, but Marc helped us fix that.  </p> <p>The model was an emotion recognition tool, which means it detected many emotions through the DeepFace library: anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear and neutral. As love wasn\u2019t part of the available emotions, we decided to treat happiness as love for the purpose of our project and label it as such in the code. We then asked the AI to only label emotions on the video when the dominant emotion was happiness. </p> <p>Other datasets we could have used: We found a model that was already trained with a dataset of pictures from Facebook users. However, if this wouldn\u2019t have been the case, we could have used this dataset to train a relevant neural network. The dataset contains 35,685 examples of 48x48 pixel gray scale images of faces divided into train and test dataset. Images are categorized based on the emotion shown in the facial expressions (happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear). </p> <p>Video Trials We first experimented with videos of ourselves and then downloaded videos from the internet. There is evident bias in our results considering that happiness was changed to love for the purposes of our project. </p> <p>Purposes It\u2019s important to note that the idea of a love detector is more fictional or based on pseudoscience rather than a well-established scientific concept, although academic research on the body language of love exists. A love detector might be used as a novelty or entertainment device for events, parties, or amusement parks. People may find it fun to use such a device even if it doesn\u2019t have any real scientific basis. Artists or creators may use the concept of a love detector as part of their projects, whether in movies, literature, or interactive installations. This could be especially useful in art installations willing to trigger reflection on our understanding of emotions and relationship to them, and how AI might perceive them. Companies may use the idea of a love detector in marketing campaigns to promote products or services related to relationships and romance, such as dating apps. In a more serious context, a hypothetical love detector might be used in relationship counseling or therapy to facilitate discussions about emotions and communication. Researchers in fields such as psychology or human-computer interaction might explore the concept of a love detector for academic purposes, although such exploration would need to be grounded in rigorous scientific methodology. More widely, an emotion detector could have more impactful uses, such as helping visually impaired individuals with sensing emotions, if these are translated into sounds through Arduino, for example. This could also help neurodivergent individuals understand people\u2019s emotions better.</p> <p>Ethics and bias: - Surveillance and Privacy Concerns: A love detector that involves monitoring and interpreting personal interactions may raise concerns about invasion of privacy. Individuals may not consent to having their emotions and flirting behaviors analyzed, especially in private or intimate settings. The use of such technology without clear consent could lead to violations of privacy rights. - Accuracy Challenges: Emotions, especially those related to love and attraction, are intricate and can vary widely among individuals. AI systems may struggle to accurately interpret the subtleties and nuances of human emotions. Misinterpretation can lead to false conclusions, causing misunderstandings and potential harm to relationships. - Subjectivity and Cultural Sensitivity: Flirting and expressions of affection are strongly influenced by cultural norms and practices. An AI system trained on data from one cultural context may not accurately interpret or recognize behaviors from another culture. This can introduce biases and inaccuracies in the system\u2019s assessments. Thorough training and consideration of cultural diversity are essential to mitigate this issue. - Emotional Nuances: Relationships involve a myriad of emotional nuances that extend beyond observable behaviors. Human connection is complex and may involve non-verbal cues, shared experiences, and emotional intelligence that AI lacks. Relying solely on AI may oversimplify the rich and multifaceted nature of human relationships. - Unintended Consequences: Introducing AI for relationship-related surveillance may inadvertently shape societal norms and expectations. Individuals may alter their behavior or interactions knowing they are being monitored, potentially leading to a distortion of natural romantic dynamics. This could impact social trust and the authenticity of human connections.</p> <p>Personal Reflection Doing this speculative project was super fun and really interesting. Even though we brainstormed different topics and conflicts we wanted to address for this project, in the end, we decided to do something fun: a love detector, and it turned out to be the best idea.</p> <p>It was \u201cthe best idea\u201d in the sense that we were highly engaged with the different outcomes we could have out of this \u201clove detector\u201d; therefore, we managed to pull closer a \u201cdifficult\u201d tool, as AI was for us, with a fun and speculative approach to make the process easier.</p> <p>Being introduced to the open source of datasets and models is amazing (Kaggle, Hugging Face, Reflect, Colab, etc.). Having all of these available and easy to use is a new skill I definitely want to explore. Personally, I\u2019ve been paying for Midjourney for the past few months because I\u2019m really into generating speculative imaginary scenarios; here are some examples:  And during these days, I have already been exploring some text-to-image models that are much more interesting than Midjourney. However, as I try different models that can do the same thing, I become more aware of the biases that AI has. Here are some examples:  </p> <p>In that way, if this happens with image-to-text models where you can visually see the errors, it raises warnings for the biases of other models that are less tangible.</p> <p>Furthermore, due to this AI project, \u201clove hacker,\u201d I modified the code so that I could have an emotion detector with my webcam. Take a look to the code: </p> <p>import cv2 from deepface import DeepFace</p> <p>face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + \u201chaarcascade_frontalface_default.xml\u201d)</p> <p>video = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)</p> <p>if not video.isOpened():     raise IOError(\u201cCannot open webcam\u201d)</p> <p>while video.isOpened():     _, frame = video.read()</p> <pre><code>gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\nface = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)\n\nfor x, y, w, h in face:\n    image = cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (89, 2, 236), 1)\n    try:\n        # analyze = DeepFace.analyze(frame[x:x+w, y:y+h], actions=['emotion'])[0]\n        analyze = DeepFace.analyze(frame, actions=['emotion'])[0]\n        region = analyze['region']\n        print(analyze['dominant_emotion'])\n        image = cv2.rectangle(frame, (region['x'], region['y']),\n                              (region['x'] + region['w'], region['y'] + region['h']), (89, 2, 236), 1)\n        cv2.putText(image, analyze['dominant_emotion'], (region['x'], region['y']), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (224, 77, 176),2)\n\n        #if analyze['dominant_emotion'] == 'happy':  # delete this if you want to see all emotions, this will only print when the dominant emotion is happy\n            #cv2.putText(image, 'love', (region['x'], region['y']), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (224, 77, 176),\n                     #   2)  # this labels happy as love but if you want to see all emotions replace with cv2.putText(image, analyze['dominant_emotion'], (x, y), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (224, 77, 176), 2)\n    except:\n        print('no face')\ncv2.imshow('video', frame)\nkey = cv2.waitKey(1)\nif key == ord('q'):\n    break\n</code></pre> <p>video.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows()</p> <p>With this tool, I believe I can use it for various purposes, but the first one was trying to connect Python with TouchDesigner to generate a visual flow of the resultant emotions. Im still struggling about how to connect Python with Touchdesigner because the TD library is not in Python, but i will explore some external ones. The expected result is that with the format of an art installation, the visuals flow regarding the facial expressions of the user.   </p>"},{"location":"term1/EI/ei-overview.html","title":"Extended Intelligences","text":"<p>About the faculty: Pau Artigas  Pau Artigas is an Interactive Web Developer at Taller Estampa.

In the first one, Wikiart\u2019s categorization categories and its image corpus were used to teach a network to recognize artistic styles. In this situation, artificial vision is forced to confront the idea of artistic style and movements, doing so from a purely formal perspective, avoiding any conceptual consideration, an area that, by definition, is beyond its understanding. In the second case, the training datasets consist of collections from various artistic institutions in Barcelona (MACBA, MNAC, Fundaci\u00f3 Mir\u00f3, Fundaci\u00f3 T\u00e0pies, Museu Picasso, and Museu del Disseny). The images in each collection are extremely heterogeneous. Forced to synthesize them, the network ends up producing absurd interpretations. In these cases, artificial vision serves to satirize the discourse on art based on classification, which inevitably homogenizes and simplifies artistic production (img. 24 and 25). While image classification networks are obsessive and compulsive, linking everything to the vocabulary they have learned, these two generate connections between any image and artistic vocabulary (img. 22).</p> <p>The training of artificial vision networks has also been carried out in other areas. In some cases, efforts were made to have the network focus more on the image than on the objects represented: we are talking about identifying concepts related to composition or representation of space (vanishing point and horizon, assuming the ideal spectator\u2019s perspective) or devices for creating the image (for example, webcam, phone, etc.). In other cases, the network was trained to identify particularly elusive artists such as Cindy Sherman or Joan Fontcuberta (img. 23).</p>"},{"location":"term2/01-futuretalks.html","title":"Future Talks","text":"<p>Future Talks is a series of conversations with friends of ELISAVA and Fab Lab Barcelona, exploring the nature of emerging futures from the past to the present and beyond.</p>"},{"location":"term2/01-futuretalks.html#about-the-distributed-design-platform","title":"About the Distributed Design Platform:","text":"<p>Emerging at the intersection of the Maker Movement and design sensibility, Distributed Design provides a framework for designers, makers and creatives to innovate the field of design towards more sustainable, open, inclusive and collaborative practices.
