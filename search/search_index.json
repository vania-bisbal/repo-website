Now that feels like a barrier, but day by day its bricks are disappearing. I have many different initial ideas of what I want to research, but I feel a bit overwhelmed by all the information about past students, other projects, or ongoing initiatives that I think I need to read about before deciding. While reading about first-person research in HCI, I think about researching the basics of design, how to make this journey the most explorative one to get to know all the design and technological specific areas more.</p> <p>A third-person point of view to systems implies designing for society in general; a second-person point of view implies designing with a group of people part of society, and a first-person point of view implies designing for yourself within the society and proposed system. To whom should I design?</p> <p>I used to design digital experiences for companies, definitely third person perspective researches was my way to get to \u201cthe truth\u201d. I\u2019ve always had in mind that i\u2019m not the measure of things and i\u2019m not the user persona, to reduce the bias in the design\u2026 but 1<sup>st</sup> person research sounds really magical as well. </p> <p>For them, a third-person perspective is non-situated. The designer becomes an expert in the context of the study by taking an objective view and designs for people without involving users and professional experts. Key actions include contextual inquiry, ethnography, surveys, and interviews, to name a few. In a second-person perspective, the designer is socially involved and facilitates co-design sessions or other kinds of workshops or forms of participation with users and professional experts who are part of the context. A first-person perspective means that designers are personally involved since they are part of and actors in the system object of study. Designers design for themselves within the context and involve their own experiences in the process.  I\u2019m intrigued about exploring first-person research. </p> <p>Let\u2019s discover it. </p> <p>Roles in prototyping</p> <p>Roles in prototyping exercise: </p> <p>Context: Carmen used to work in Incapto. They designed a coffee machine prototype full with bottons to personalize the experience, but they run a test with different types of users to see if this actually worked for the users. This was a role 2 prototyping because its an instrument of inquiry, where they wanted to collect, record and measure this phenomena. </p> <p>Moreover, </p>"},{"location":"term1/03-DocumentingDesign/","title":"# Documenting Design","text":""},{"location":"term1/04-AtlasofWeakSignals/","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals","text":"<p>Atlas of Weak Signals: a game, an uthopy, a debate or an inspirational seed. </p> <p>Everything started here: insert video</p> <p>Checkout my process:</p> <p>My personal AoWs: </p> <p>We can reconfigure out minds, congnitivity, body, health, etc. Deconstruct our built sistemic thinking is a way of reconfiguration. Algorithms to biohack yourself sound really interesting because if technology and climate change are evolving, we could evolve in different ways to adapt to these futures. Digital fabrications can be use to distribute or communicate on an easier way how a body reconfiguration works or maybe collaborate with the technology in-house to do it.
