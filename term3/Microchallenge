## Microchallenge: digital twin 
For this microchallenge I wanted to learn more about touch designer and be able to use it with different inputs. Lately for my project I was researching about Mediapipe and its different possibilities, me and Jorge were really intrigued about itis connection with artisany. So for this challenge even though we didnt do it together each one wanted to learn a different skill during this microchallenge, we collaborated to understand the tool better and make some workaround in our process.
